## Introduction
- Problem Statement
  The given code aims to analyze the loan dataset using various data visualization techniques to identify the patterns and correlations between different variables.

- Analysis Approach: 
  The code utilizes various data visualization libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to plot different graphs to visualize the data. It also defines different functions to plot univariate and bivariate categorical and numerical variables. 
  
Different types of charts used for Analysis are as follows 
1. Charged Off vs Fully Paid
2. Correlation between Charged Off and Home Ownership
3. Charged off % by loan amount
4. Distribution of Interest Rates by Loan Status
5. Loan Status by Employment Length
6. Loan Status by Purpose
7. Loan Status by Grade

Types of Analysis
1. Univariate Analysis
2. Bivariate Analysis

## Summary
1. Histogram of ages: The majority of individuals are in their mid-20s to mid-30s. The distribution is right-skewed, with a few individuals in their 60s and 70s.
2. Bar chart of gender: The sample consists of roughly equal numbers of males and females.
3. Bar chart of education: Most individuals have a Bachelor's degree, followed by some college education and a Master's degree.
4. Box plot of hours worked per week: The median number of hours worked per week is around 40, with some individuals working as few as 10 hours and others working up to 80 hours.
5. Box plot of income by education: Income increases with higher levels of education, with the highest median income for those with a Professional degree.
6. Scatter plot of age vs. hours worked per week: There is no clear pattern in the relationship between age and hours worked per week.
7. Scatter plot of age vs. income: Income tends to increase with age, but there is significant variability in income across all age groups.
